# code_and_Dcode_Text_with_GUI-_using_Python_and_TkinterV1
This Python program allows you to encrypt and decrypt text using a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with Tkinter. The code and decoden process is done using Base64 encoding.
Dependencies:
Tkinter: Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python.
Usage:

Run the Python script, and a window will open with two text areas and password input field.
Enter your message in the "Enter MSG Here" text area.
Type the password "waqas113" in the "Enter your password" input field to proceed with code or decode.
Click the "CODE" button to encrypt the entered text.
Click the "DCODE" button to decrypt the encrypted text.
Click the "RESET" button to clear the text areas and password field.
Important Notes:
The password "waqas113" is used as a security measure to access encryption and decryption features. You can change it as per your requirements.
Ensure that you have the required packages installed (Tkinter) before running the script.
This program uses Base64 code for simplicity and may not be suitable for highly secure encryption needs.
Use the encryption feature responsibly and avoid using it for sensitive or confidential data without proper encryption algorithms.
Disclaimer:
This program is intended for educational and demonstration purposes only. The security measures implemented in this script are basic and may not be sufficient for robust code and decode. Always use appropriate code techniques when dealing with sensitive information or production-level applications.
